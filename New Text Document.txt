This widget allows you to perform some action on click. Flutter does not allow you to use the Button widget directly; instead, it uses a type of buttons like a FlatButton and a RaisedButton. We can use it as like below code snippets.
1.	//FlatButton Example  
2.	new FlatButton(  
3.	  child: Text("Click here"),  
4.	  onPressed: () {  
5.	    // Do something here  
6.	  },  
7.	),  
8.	  
9.	//RaisedButton Example  
10.	new RaisedButton(  
11.	  child: Text("Click here"),  
12.	  elevation: 5.0,  
13.	  onPressed: () {  
14.	    // Do something here  
15.	  },  
16.	),  
In the above example, the onPressed property allows us to perform an action when you click the button, and elevation property is used to change how much it stands out.
