This widget allows you to perform some action on click. Flutter does not allow you to use the Button widget directly; instead, it uses a type of buttons like a FlatButton and a RaisedButton. We can use it as like below code snippets.
1.	//FlatButton Example  
2.	new FlatButton(  
3.	  child: Text("Click here"),  
4.	  onPressed: () {  
5.	    // Do something here  
6.	  },  
7.	),  
8.	  
9.	//RaisedButton Example
